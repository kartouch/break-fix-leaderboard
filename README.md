Summit leaderboard for the Break Fix challenge.
UPDATE: Monday, April 17th at 5:30pm


## Development commands

Start server: http-server

navigate to: /src


## Notes

Color Profile
   Depending on the screen and color settings, you may need to adjust the final color profile. I'm viewing this on a retina display and found inconsistencies on other screens.

Zoom
   You shouldn't need to adjust the zoom when the leaderboard is using a full screen.
   - I'm still making changes to the element sizing.


leaderboard.js explains how the data is passed through.


## To Do:

  Allyson should provide a printed demo for whoever is manning this booth with instructions on how to manage the color profile.

  Animate through the 9 endpoints using a transition based on time interval 10-20 seconds.
  - Test the combination of animations and determine the best setup for Break Fix.
