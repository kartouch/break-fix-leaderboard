# Break Fix Leaderboard

Summit leaderboard for the Break Fix challenge.
UPDATE: Friday, April 21st at 4:30pm


## Development commands

Start server: http-server

navigate to: /src


## Notes

Color Profile
   Depending on the screen and color settings, you may need to adjust the final color profile. I'm viewing this on a retina display and found inconsistencies on other screens.

Zoom
   You shouldn't need to adjust the zoom when the leaderboard is using a full screen.
   - I'm still making changes to the element sizing.


leaderboard.js explains how the data is passed through.


## To Do:

  Transition:
    - Transition challenge subtitles: Needs improvement, but works!


  Local Overpass font
    - This might be a last minute addition (stay tuned)
